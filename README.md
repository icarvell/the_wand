========

First spike of mingle iOS app to scan QR-Codes on a card wall and then update the status in a mingle instance with a flick of the phone.

Very much a spike and first exploration of iOS developmemt. Everything happens in WandViewController. Next thing would be to refactor and spilt it up into proper objects.
